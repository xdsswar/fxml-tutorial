# JavaFX Controller Initialization and Parameter Passing Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to effectively initialize JavaFX controllers by implementing the `Initializable` interface and how to pass controllers with parameters to FXML files. This knowledge will help you build dynamic and interactive JavaFX applications.

## Introduction

JavaFX is a powerful framework for building rich graphical user interfaces in Java. One important aspect of JavaFX development is controlling the behavior of your UI elements through controllers. This tutorial demonstrates two essential concepts:

1. Initializing JavaFX Controllers: Learn how to implement the `Initializable` interface to perform initialization tasks when a controller is constructed.

2. Passing Controllers with Parameters: Discover how to pass data and parameters to controllers when loading FXML files, enabling dynamic content display.


## Run

To run your JavaFX project using Gradle with the Application plugin, follow these steps:

1. **Build Your Project:**

   Ensure that your Gradle project is properly built. You can use the following Gradle command to build your project:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   
2. **Run the application:**

    ```bash
   ./gradlew run
